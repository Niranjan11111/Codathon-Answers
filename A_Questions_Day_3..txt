Description

Two arrays are said to be compatible if they are of the same size and if the ith element in the first array is greater than or equal to the ith element in the second array for all the values of i. Write a program to find whether 2 arrays are compatible or not.



Input Format

Input consists of 2n+2 integers. The first integer corresponds to ‘n1’, the size of the first array. The next ‘n1’ integers correspond to the elements in the first array. The next (n+1) integer corresponds to 'n2', the size of the second array. The last 'n2' integers correspond to the elements in the second array.



Output Format

The output is any one of the two strings "Compatible" or "Incompatible"

Description

A bus stop queue has 'n' groups of people. The i-th group from the beginning has 'ai' people. Every 30 minutes an empty bus arrives at the bus stop, it can carry atmost 'm' people. Naturally, the people from the first group enter the bus first. Then goes the people from the second group and so on. Note that the order of groups in the queue never changes. Moreover, if some group cannot fit all of its members into the current bus, it waits for the next bus and joins with the other groups standing after them in the queue. Your task is to determine the number of buses needed to transport all 'n' groups to the Jeju Island countryside.



Input Format

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The next line contains n integers: a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ m).



Output Format

Print a single integer — the number of buses needed to transport all n groups to the Jeju Island countryside.

Description

Arjuna and Karna were playing cards. Arjuna has 5 cards. Karna wants to insert a new card in between Arjuna's cards. Karna wants to find the position to insert the card. So help him to find the position to insert a certain card. If Karna inserts a card in a position other than the position of 5 cards, the game will be over. So play carefully.

For example, consider an array having three elements in it initially and a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2 and a[2] = 3 and you want to insert a number 45 at location 1 i.e. a[0] = 45, so we have to move elements one step below after insertion a[1] = 1, and a[2] = 2 and a[3] = 3.



Input Format

The input consists of four integers. The first input corresponds to the size of an array. The second input corresponds to the array elements. The third input corresponds to the location where you wish to insert an element. The fourth input corresponds to the element to be inserted.



Output Format

The output consists of array elements in a format after insertion. If the position where the element has to be inserted is greater than size of the array, then print Invalid Input.

Description

In the city of Toyland, there are N houses. Noddy is looking for a piece of land in the city to build his house. All the houses in the city lie in a straight line and all of them are given a house number and position of the house from the entry point of the city. Noddy wants to find the house numbers between which he can build the largest house. Write an algorithm to help Noddy to find the house numbers between which he can build his house.

Hint: No two houses will have the same position in case of multiple such answers, print the one with the least distance from the reference point.



Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer num, representing the number of houses (N). The next N lines consist of two space-separated integers – house Num and pos, representing the house number and the position of the houses.



Constraints

2 < num < 10^6
1 < house Num < num
0 < pos < 10^6


Output Format

Print two space-separated integers representing the house numbers in ascending order between which the largest plot is available.

Description

An oil factory has N number of containers and each has a different capacity. During renovation, the manager decided to make some changes with the containers. He wishes to make different pairs for the containers in such a way that in the first pair, the container of maximum capacity is paired with the container of minimum capacity, and so on for the rest of the containers, to maintain a balance throughout all the pairs of containers.
Write an algorithm to make different pairs of containers in such a way that the first container in the pair is of maximum capacity and second container in the pair is of minimum capacity.


Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer - numContainers, representing the number of containers (N).
The next line consists of N space-separated integers - cont1, cont2, .... contN, representing container capacity.


Constraints

1 <= numContainers <= 1000
1 <= conti <= 1000
1 <= i <= numContainers


Output Format

Print K lines consisting of two space-separated integers representing the pairs that will be formed to maintain the balance by pairing the container of maximum capacity with the container of minimum capacity and so on.


Note
If only one container is left and no pair is possible then print the capacity of that container and the second value will be '0'.
